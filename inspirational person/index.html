						<h3>Early life</h3>
						<p>
							Born Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro on February 5, 1985, in
							Funchal, Madeira, Portugal, a small island off the western coast
							of the country, Ronaldo is the youngest of four children born to
							Maria Dolores dos Santos and Jose Dinis Aveiro. He was named after
							Ronald Reagan, one of his father's favorite actors.
						</p>
						<br />
						<p>
							Ronaldo grew up in a largely working class neighborhood in a small
							tin-roofed home that overlooked the ocean. His early life was
							shaped by hardship; his father, a gardener, often drank too much,
							and eventually died from kidney problems in 2005. To help keep the
							children fed, and maintain some financial stability, Ronaldo's
							mother worked as a cook and cleaning person.

						<h3>Intro to Soccer</h3>
						<p>
							It was through his dad's work as an equipment manager at a boy's
							club that Ronaldo was first introduced to the game of soccer. By
							the time he was 10 years old, he was already recognized as a
							phenomenon—a kid who ate, slept and drank the game. "All he wanted
							to do as a boy was play football," his godfather, Fernao Sousa,
							recalled for British reporters, adding, "He loved the game so much
							he'd miss meals or escape out of his bedroom window with a ball
							when he was supposed to be doing his homework." By his early
							teens, Ronaldo's talent and legend had grown considerably. After a
							stint with Nacional da liha da Madeira, he signed with Sporting
							Portugal in 2001. That same year, at the tender age of 16, Ronaldo
							turned heads with a mesmerizing performance against Manchester
							United, wowing even his opponents with his footwork and deft
							skill. He made such an impression that a number of United players
							asked their manager to try and sign the young player. It wasn't
							long before the club paid Ronaldo's team more than £12 million for
							his services - a record fee for a player of his age.

							<h3>Success with Manchester United</h3>
							<p>
								Ronaldo did not disappoint the soccer world. He showed his
								promise early on in the 2004 FA Cup final, scoring the team's
								first three goals and helping them capture the championship. In
								2008, a year after signing a five-year, £31 million contract,
								Ronaldo again justified his high salary when he put together one
								of the club's finest seasons in history, setting a franchise
								record for goals scored (42), and earning himself the FIFA World
								of the Year honor. In all, Ronaldo helped steer Manchester
								United to three premier league titles. But Ronaldo's time in
								England was marred by his mother's 2007 struggle with breast
								cancer as well as his father's death from alcohol-related
								illness. The latter was especially hard for Ronaldo as the two
								had been close, and the young athlete had often pushed for his
								father to enter rehab and address his drinking. His father,
								however, never accepted the offer.

							<h3>Real Madrid & National Victory</h3>
							<p>
								As lauded as Ronaldo was on the field for Manchester United, his
								commitment to the club came under constant question. Speculation
								swirled that he wanted to play elsewhere. So in 2009, when
								Spanish soccer club Real Madrid agreed to pay United a record
								$131 million for the chance to sign him, nobody was all that
								surprised to see Ronaldo leave United. "I know that they are
								going to demand a lot of me to be successful at the club and I
								know that I'm going to have much more pressure than at
								Manchester United because I was there for many years," Ronaldo
								told reporters. "But it means a new challenge and is going to
								help me be the best footballer." In addition to his FIFA World
								Player of the year award, Ronaldo has also won the coveted
								Ballon d'OR, the Golden Boot, and been named the UEFA Club
								Forward of the Year, among other honors during the course of his
								career. On July 10, 2016, Ronaldo added another emotional
								victory to his accolades, leading Portugal to the European
								Championship final against France as his national team's
								captain. Although he was sidelined after suffering a knee injury
								25 minutes into the match, Portugal went on to win the
								championship title 1-0, their first international trophy.
								Ronaldo's teammates said that he motivated them as team captain
								from the sidelines. "He gave us a lot of confidence and he said,
								'Listen people, I'm sure we will win this Euro so stay together
								and fight for it,’” full-back Cedric Soares said after
								Portugal’s victory. "This is one of the happiest moments in my
								career,” Ronaldo commented. ”I’ve always said I wanted to win a
								trophy with the national team and make history. And I did it.
								Thank God, things went well for us." In January 2017, Ronaldo
								won FIFA's 2016 best player of the year for the fourth time,
								beating out Lionel Messi. Ronaldo’s 2016 wins included the
								European Championship, Champions League, and Club World Cup,
								plus individual awards from UEFA and France Football magazine,
								according to USA Today. In his acceptance speech, Ronaldo said:
								"2016 was the best year of my career."
